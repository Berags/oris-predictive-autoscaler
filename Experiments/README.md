## Import Experiments

To generate the same report of the experiment you need to follow these steps:

 1. Export data from Grafana dashboards as CSV 
 (Note: toggle the option formatted data, and for the Queue Metrics Dashboard extract both Arrived and Rejected)
 2. Save those CSV with the correct names. They can be easily be induced by the Notebook names.
 3. Put all the CSV related to one test in a common directory.
